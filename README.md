# ðŸŒ´ My Very Own Personal Site!

![]()

This is my personal website - for now it's a simple landing page with my intro and projects.

I plan to make v2 with a full fledged website, fully functional with a blog and other cool stuff!

# âœ¨ To-Do Doodle Do

- [ ] Add an actual resume lmao
- [ ] Make more projects and add em
- [ ] Work on integrating a blog
- [ ] Think about a complete redesign
- [ ] Add more easter eggs
- [ ] A github contribution history kinda thing
- [ ] Adding a timeline would be cool
- [ ] A game being played by AI/ML (dino, pacman or snake)

# ðŸ‘€ A side quest

I love easter eggs and adding quirky things to my projects,
So ofcourse there are some in my website! See if you can find em!
